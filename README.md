* Another option is for users to input any ingredients they have and find recipes that include any of those ingredients (API)
* Shopping list feature that can add/delete ingredients

Example Cases
* Users can start planning their meals on Sunday and write out their plans for breakfast/lunch/dinner for the week and plan out the entire list of ingredients so that user can shop accordingly. User can input the amount of servings needed for each meal and the amount ingredients will be calculated according to ammount of servings
