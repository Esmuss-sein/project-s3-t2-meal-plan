An brief assessment of the team’s existing strengths
Are there folks on your team that already have skills in one more important areas?
Can these folks help to onboard and train some of the other team members?
Can you “stategically pair”
An brief assessment of areas where the team needs to develop it’s knowledge
What are the most signficant gaps in your team’s knowledge?
A plan that includes specific committments by each team member (by name) as to what they will do over the next week (week 3) and the following week (week 4) to improve their skills
The plan could include things like:

John commits to working through a tutorial on basic HTML/CSS during week 3, and a tutorial on React and React-Bootstrap during week 4.
Susan commits to working through a tutorial on MongoDB during week 3, and learning how to work with MongoDB in a Next.js app during week 4.
Alice and Bob will pair together during the MVP iteration, since Alice has more experience with the tech stack. Alice and Bob will use strong-style pairing with Bob at the keyboard as much as possible, until Bob feels confident.
