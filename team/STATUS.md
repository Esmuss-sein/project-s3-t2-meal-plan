## Sprint Goal for 05/12-05/21
  
### Question asked
* When we achieve this Sprint Goal, what has clearly changed or improved from the perspective of stakeholders?

### Sprint Goal
* We want to implement the search for a recipe function, and be able to add the outputted recipe to a user's existing planner.
* We came up with this goal, because we believe that the search function is a crucial aspect of our envisioned product. This would be a beneficial thing to consider from the perspective of stakeholders.
  
## Discussion of previous Sprint Goal
* Our goal was a bit broad, however we were successful in achieving it, and we were all clear on what specifically was needed to do. Our sprint goal wasn't too ambitious nor too modest.
