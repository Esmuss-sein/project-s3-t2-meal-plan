# Retro 04/20/20
* Led by Peter Brede
* Everyone is present
* Absent: None

## Start Ideas
* Using Lab00 as a template/starter code for our Web App
* Sharing links/articles/advice on Slack with eachother not during classtime
* Once we begin building our product, begin meeting outside of classtime with eachother in pairs or alltogether

## Stop Ideas
* Nothing at the moment

## Continue Ideas
* Continue pursuing learning mongoDB and its respective tutorials for Amanda and Peter
* Learning connections between HTML and Next.js
* Openly communicate with team members

## Action Item
* By next week (Monday), we would like to have a basic, running webpage with basic UI and something running with MongoDB

## Retro Assessment

* We used a :), :(, Idea, Appreciation format of grouping ideas in order to clarify Start/Stop/Continue ideas.
* Everybody participated and gave valuable opinions on their personal experience with their learning process.
* Advice for the next person leading a retro: Have a standard outline for the retro that our team is used to so that everyone knows what to expect and prepare for. Nobody really knew (including myself) what to expect out of our first retro.
