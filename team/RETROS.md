# Retro 04/20/20
* Led by Peter Brede
* Everyone is present
* Absent: None

## Start Ideas
* Using Lab00 as a template/starter code for our Web App
* Sharing links/articles/advice on Slack with eachother not during classtime
* Once we begin building our product, begin meeting outside of classtime with eachother in pairs or alltogether

## Stop Ideas
* Nothing at the moment

## Continue Ideas
* Continue pursuing learning mongoDB and its respective tutorials for Amanda and Peter
* Learning connections between HTML and Next.js
* Openly communicate with team members

## Action Item
* By next week (Monday), we would like to have a basic, running webpage with basic UI and something running with MongoDB

## Retro Assessment

* We used a :), :(, Idea, Appreciation format of grouping ideas in order to clarify Start/Stop/Continue ideas.
* Everybody participated and gave valuable opinions on their personal experience with their learning process.
* Advice for the next person leading a retro: Have a standard outline for the retro that our team is used to so that everyone knows what to expect and prepare for. Nobody really knew (including myself) what to expect out of our first retro.



# Retro 05/04/20

* Led by: Arun Ryu
* Present:Everyone (Amanda Serex, Peter Brede, ChanChan Mao)
* Absent: None

## Action item

* a goal: All team members learn about the spoonacular API and figure out how data are used.
* a change: 1. All team members learn about how to pull out data from MongoDb 
            2. Attend office hours right away if there's any issue. 
* a measurement: We set our goal and dead line for each goal, and if we achieve it, it means things are going well. 

## Retro Assessment

* We used a five step retro, started with three words describing last iteration to reminds ourselves. Next, we do the Genie in a Bottle and The Worst We could Do to gather our concern and ideas to improve the next iteration. Finally, we did Divide the Dollar to evaluate how much the idea worth and conclude the most important idea. At the end, we close the retro by appreciations.
* Maybe focus on step 4 more because I feel we can talk a bit more about the most important idea, and figure out more specific solutions. Ex. Instead of all team members learn about API, what can we do to learn API more successfully.
